Create a blank Vite React.js project in Webstorm with Typescript enabled:  
Webstorm -> New Project -> Vite -> Template: react -> check Use TypeScript Template

Create `Form.tsx`, that is used in `App.tsx`, to create a simple medical device request web form. Create `Requests.tsx` to
display the requests that have been entered into the system. Place any additional TSX and TS files in the src folder. 
Note that this is a front-end application. Instead of a database backend, you will just store the form data locally into a
useState hook. See team coaching sessions for more information on forms.
